# Image Integration Instructions

## Adding Your Images to the Project

### 1. Study Abroad Success Card Image
The first image you shared (the "Study Abroad Success" card) has been integrated into the HeroSection component. The design now matches the style from your image with:
- Clean white card with rounded corners
- Blue globe icon
- Color-coded bullet points (green, blue, purple, orange)
- Pastel decorative elements

### 2. Professional Headshot Image
The second image (professional headshot) can be used for testimonials. To add it:

1. **Save the image** to `public/images/` directory
2. **Name it** something like `mentor-headshot.jpg` or `testimonial-avatar.jpg`
3. **Update the TestimonialsSection** to use the actual image

### How to Add the Headshot Image:

1. **Save your image** to: `public/images/mentor-headshot.jpg`

2. **Update the TestimonialsSection component** by replacing the avatar div with:

```tsx
<div className="w-12 h-12 rounded-full mr-4 overflow-hidden">
  <img 
    src="/images/mentor-headshot.jpg" 
    alt="Professional mentor headshot"
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
</div>
```

### 3. Additional Image Opportunities

You can also add images to:
- **BenefitsSection**: Add icons or illustrations for each benefit
- **HowItWorksSection**: Add step-by-step illustrations
- **PricingSection**: Add feature icons
- **CTASection**: Add background images or illustrations

### 4. Image Optimization

For best performance:
- Use **WebP** format when possible
- Keep images under **200KB** for avatars
- Use **Next.js Image component** for larger images:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/your-image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={400}
  height={300}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
```

### 5. Current Integration Status

✅ **Study Abroad Success Card**: Integrated into HeroSection
⏳ **Professional Headshot**: Ready for integration (see steps above)

The design now perfectly matches the clean, minimalist style from your images with the pastel backgrounds and professional appearance!
